<p>pureLog is a plugin for PRoCon that logs game server popularity in a MySQL database by measuring player-minutes spent in game. 
A player-minute is defined as a single minute spent connected to the server by a player. 
The pureLog Web Interface allows users to view the daily player-minute totals from the web in a graphical, visualized format.
Results are compiled at the beginning of each new day, so the results of the current day will only be available the day after.</p>
